## General Information

- **`WILL FAIL TO DOWNLOAD PROPERLY`** if using McAfee Scanner, SecureAge, VirIT, or Zillya antivirus
- The stamps menu might take a moment to launch
- You can **paste images** into the menu directly or **select a file**
- Images are automatically adjusted to be **upright relative to the player camera**
- **In-game canvases** can display a single 200x200 image. I recommend keeping images below this size
- **Off-canvas**: Only one image can be placed at a time
- Be mindful of **performance and lag**, especially when playing GIFs. This is a **server side mod**, and people play on potatoes lol
