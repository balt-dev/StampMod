--- Instructions for Use In-Game ---

 - key: will open my image processing gui. includes a save menu. once an image has finished processing it will be available for use in game. 

 = key: spawn in an image where the cursor is (MAX OF ONE if not on a game canvas) OR will play a gif if a gif is placed down

 shift and = keys: will spawn in an image where the player is OR will toggle gif mode if a gif is placed down

 CTRL and = keys: will spawn in an image for viewing at the dock

 Backspace Key: functions as CTRL Z for images placed down.

--- general info ---

be patient, my GUI might take a second to launch. but you can keep it open... !

images are automatically adjusted to be upright relative to the player camera.

in game canvases can display one 200 * 200 image - I recommend keeping image size at 200 or below

only one image can be placed off the in game canvases at a time.
